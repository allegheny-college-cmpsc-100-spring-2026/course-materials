possible, reserve appointments using this system. 

#### Course Description

An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce computational artifacts which address these problems in real-world contexts. Students also learn how to organize and document a program’s source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

Distribution requirements: `ME`, `SP`

#### Course Learning Objectives

1. Apply Python programming fundamentals to execute and explain computer code that implements interactive, novel solutions to a variety of computable problems.
2. Implement code consistent with industry-standard practices using professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems.
3. Analyze and suggest revisions to existing Python language code to add functionality or repair defects.
4. Evaluate the practical and ethical implications of writing computer code and discuss the contexts, perceived effects, and impacts exerted on and by computer code as a cultural force or artifact.
5. Design, describe, and implement original projects incorporating industry-standard practices and Python language fundamentals.

#### Distribution Requirement Objectives

#####  Modes of Expression (ME)

The study of Modes of Expression explores individual and/or collective modes of expression, focusing upon the ways in which these modes create meaning and communicate thoughts, emotions, or beliefs to others. By engaging in hands-on experience, students interrogate the act of communication itself.

###### Learning Outcome

Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the production of meaning through active engagement with language, visual arts, and/or performance.

Course learning outcomes `1`, `2`, `4`, and `5` satisfy the `ME` learning outcome.

##### Scientific Process & Knowledge (SP)

Courses involving Scientific Process & Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

###### Learning Outcome

Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

Course learning outcomes `1`, `2`, `3`, and `5` satisfy the `SP` learning outcome.

### Required materials

#### Textbook

This course does not use a standard textbook. Any additional materials required for the course will be provided by the instructor.

#### Platforms

Our work relies on your regular use of:

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Discord](https://discord.com)

##### Github

Github is an industry-standard system for storing and _versioning_ (keeping working and finished copies of) software.
In a professional environment, developers `push` (or "upload") work to the platform multiple times per day to keep
their colleagues informed of changes made or in progress. 

As such, this course treats Github the same way: a method to consistently "show your work," unlike a platform such as Canvas where it's more likely that a student submits final work rather than work-in-process. Course assignments will be distributed through the Github platform. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Course learning staff (TLs, instructor(s)) will only review content _on the Github platform_.

This means that you should keep your work > up to date.

#### Discord

The [Discord chat platform](https://discord.com) serves as the primary communications channel for course information. As courses in the CIS Department feature additional context or extended Q&A, it's importnant for students to keep up-to-date on posts to 
the channel. The instructor recommends that students download and install the destop application for Discord to monitor
channel activity. 

#### Grading and Evaluation

Given the technical nature of work in disciplines related to computer science, you may be tempted to think that this
course is only about one thing: the _right_ answer: whether the software _works_. While it's important for programs
to function, we're interested in much more than "yes" or "no" answers.

This course is broken down into `3` related types of evaluation with sub-components:

* class activities
* lab assignments
    * code reviews
    * technical benchmarks
* a final project
    * code reviews
    * technical benchmarks

Final grading represents these categories in the following schedule:

|Evaluation Type |Points Possible  |
|:---------------|:----------------|
|Class Activities|15               |
|Lab Assignments |50               |
|Final Project   |35               |
|**Total**       |**100**          |

This course adopts the follow final letter grade scale:

|             |            |             |            |             |            |
|:------------|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|
|`A`            | 95 - 100   |`A-`           | 90 - 94.9  |
|`B+`           | 87 - 89.9  |`B`            | 83 - 86.9  |`B-`           | 80 - 82.9  |
|`C+`           | 77 - 79.9  |`C`            | 73 - 76.9  |`C-`           | 70 - 72.9  |
|`D+`           | 67 - 69.9  |`D`            | 63 - 66.9  |`D-`           | 60 - 62.9  |
|`F`            | 59.9 and below |

Grades will be reported to our course's [`Canvas`](https://allegheny.instructure.com) gradebook.

##### Class Activities

Frequently, we will use class to explore a given concept using an activity. These activities will be kept in a `repository`
you control in our course Github organzation. When starting an activity, students will be directed to retrieve new
content and, when the activity is finished, will be prompted to `push` the content back to the course's Github platform
to reflect participation.

Submitted work must pass a minimal set of technical requirements to count as having been submitted.

##### Lab Assignments

Each week features a capstone lab assignment giving students an opportunity to demonstrate the lesson(s) learned during
a given week. Labs feature technical challenges with guidelines for code reviews and a summary of technical requirements.
These areas of evaluation will feature into the breakdown of a final grade awarded to each lab assignment.

###### Code Reviews

Code review is a process used like an essay's peer review; instead of writing, our goal is to understand and maintain code quality. Often, changes to code happen _because_ of a code review. Rarely should a code review process "rubber stamp" changes. Think of this as a conversation betwee yourself and someone who has been in exactly the same position as you: as a learner. Sometimes, you may even be able to teach your reviewer a new trick!

These reviews will be conducted by TLs and/or the instructor during lab sessions. You must be present to receive credit
for participating in a code review as it will consist of manual review of source code as well as an in-person discussion
of the work in progress.

###### Technical Requirements

This courses uses `Gatorgrader`, a department-developed and maintained software that tests code for specific benchmarks including
reading and executing source code. Each assignment will have a clear list of specifications required to pass its given technical
requirements. Students will be able to use the `gatorgrade` tool to assess their progress on these technical requirements.

##### Final Project

In the closing weeks of the semester, students will engage in a final project that represents their cumulative learning
over the course of the semester. Like [Lab Assignments](#lab-assignments), this project will feature code review and
various techical benchmarks.

### Policies

This course follows [CIS Department policies](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/teaching/policies/) with some additions described
below.

#### Attendance

General department policy allows for no more than two weeks of absences without the impact to the course grade. In this class, this means that for each 8 sessions for which a student is absent, their letter grade will be reduced _one full letter_.

#### Late assignments

Late assignments will not be accepted unless a token is applied, ideally before the assignment deadline. To apply a token, complete [this form](). The token can not be used for a final project.

These tokens are no‑questions‑asked. They are meant to accommodate emergencies, illnesses, athletic events, so there
is no need to provide an excuse when applying a token.

As an introductory course, you have `4` tokens. Each can do one of the following:
- Extend one assignment's deadline by two weeks
- Allow resubmit of one lab assignment two weeks after receiving your grade. 
  * Resubmits can only be used on projects where an on‑time attempt was made (an attempt means that you have started the assignment and tried at least half the objectives).

#### Artificial Intelligence

Generally speaking, the CIS Department embraces a generous AI use policy. However, because this is a 100 level class where the acquisition and practice of basic skills is critical:

> [!WARNING]
> Use of artificial intelligence to generate code is _not_ permitted.

#### Allegheny College Policy and Awareness Statements

##### Statement of Community

>  Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms.

##### Academic Integrity

Allegheny College has a student-run Honor Code designed to promote individual responsibility and integrity in academic affairs. Each student pledges the following: “I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.” Your professor will educate you about the meaning of academic integrity in this course, which may be different in some respects from other courses in which you are enrolled. Please ask the professor if you have questions. Please see [academic honor program's website](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/academic-honor-program/) for more details.

##### Midterm Grades

Midterm grades will be submitted for all students in this course by Monday, March 17, but will not appear on academic transcripts. By giving you an early indication of your performance so far, midterm grades offer an opportunity to make adjustments, if necessary, before the end of the term. While midterm grades are primarily focused on first and second-year students, upper-level students may also receive them in some courses. This feedback is a key part of our commitment to supporting your academic journey. 

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the instructor. See the instructor's office hours schedule under the [Important Resources](#important-resources) heading above.

#### Academic Alerts

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

#### Mental Health and Wellness

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

Keep in mind, course deadlines, absences, and accommodations for mental health are subject to the course policies and expectations that are set within this syllabus. Students are encouraged to communicate with their professors as soon as possible regarding their needs and seek support if their mental health impacts their academic performance or daily life. When you find yourself struggling emotionally, remember that there are supports available, and you are not alone.

Students who are in need of mental health services can access resources to receive support.  Allegheny College has partnered with ECPS (Edinboro Counseling and Psychological Services) to provide in-person therapy on campus. The ECPS partnership with Allegheny College delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student community through brief individual counseling, and crisis support.

#### Gator Success Grants

The [Gator Success Grant](https://sites.allegheny.edu/gator-success-grants/) program is designed to provide students with additional financial assistance to offset the total cost of college attendance and to encourage successful on-time degree completion. Currently enrolled students who have an unanticipated need are invited to apply. Grants are usually from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the request and the student's need. Please direct questions to studentsuccess@allegheny.edu.

#### Writing and Speaking Consultants 

Experienced peer writing and speaking consultants in the Maytum Center for Student Success help writers and speakers make academically responsible choices and determine strategies for effective communication at any stage in the writing or speaking process, for assignments in any discipline, or for writing and speaking situations unrelated to coursework (e.g., personal statements, cover letters, interviews, conference presentations). Both appointments and drop-in sessions are available. To view the hours of operation, and to make an appointment, visit the [Maytum Center for Student Success website](https://sites.allegheny.edu/maytum-center-student-success/writing-speech/).

#### Gator Days and Scholar Symposium 

Each semester, the college sets aside one Gator Day for programming, with no classes. Fall Gator Day is held on the first Tuesday in November (coinciding with election day). Spring Gator Day is held on a Monday in early April. These all-college programming days  feature programs and workshops that highlight educational opportunities at Allegheny, that prepare students for life after graduation, and that help to create a greater sense of campus community. Additionally, in the Spring, during the Richard J Cook–Teresa M Lahti Scholars Symposium (the day immediately after classes end and before exams begin), we gather to celebrate student research, scholarship, and creative activities on campus.

#### Class Deans 

The [Office of Class Deans](https://sites.allegheny.edu/maytum-center-student-success/class-deans/) in Pelletier Library serves as a place for students to begin seeking assistance and answers to their questions related to college life. If you have a question and don’t know who to ask – ask a class dean. If you want advice – talk to a class dean. Aacha Gregg is the First Year Class Dean, Amy Stearns is the Second Year Class Dean / Director of Transfer Advising, and Carene Shipley is the Third/Fourth Year Class Dean. Dom Turner is the Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, located in Schultz Hall. Please contact them individually or through studentsuccess@allegheny.edu.

#### The Well

The Center for Wellbeing, Life Design, and Community Engagement (The Well) empowers students to live meaningful, connected, and balanced lives at Allegheny College. The Well nurtures student wellbeing, affirms identity, and cultivates lifelong habits of service, purpose, and reflection through holistic support and programming from professional staff. Please visit The Well (in the Campus Center and Pelletier Library) if you would like to chat with professional staff about your purpose or need more information about community engagement opportunities. For more information, please feel free to contact [Dom Turner](dturner@allegheny.edu).

#### Recording Policy

Allegheny College values freedom of expression and respects individuals’ rights to privacy, the integrity of the classroom experience, faculty and College rights in instructional materials and applicable copyright law.  Both faculty and students have the reasonable expectation that class content is shared only with those who are members of the Allegheny College community; therefore, audio, video, or cell phone recording of any class at Allegheny is prohibited unless prior written permission of the instructor has been obtained and all students in the class as well as guest speakers have been informed that audio/video recording may occur. Classes may also be recorded if approved as an educational accommodation through Student Accessibility and Support services.  Recordings may not be reproduced or uploaded to publicly accessible web environments, nor may they be exchanged or distributed for commercial purposes, for compensation, or for any purpose other than individual or group study, except with the express written permission of the involved parties.  See Section 9.8 of the Faculty Handbook for the full policy.

#### Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Reporting

Allegheny College is committed to providing a workplace and educational environment that is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct. The College expressly prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, religion, and disability. Allegheny College prohibits sex-based harassment, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking regardless of the gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation of the individuals involved in any education program or activity that it operates, as required by Title IX, including admission and employment.

Allegheny College adheres to all federal, state, and local civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and education. The College does not discriminate in its admissions practices, in its employment practices, or in its educational programs or activities. Allegheny College also prohibits retaliation against any person participating in good faith in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the institution; for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment or for assisting someone with such a complaint.

Allegheny College is required to respond promptly and effectively, utilizing a fair, transparent, and reliable process, when they have knowledge of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in its program, and must take steps to prevent the recurrence of discrimination and remedy its effects, the college must communicate their policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their programs and must monitor and address barriers to reporting instances of sex discrimination.

Allegheny College employees must notify their Title IX Coordinator when they have information that may reasonably rise to the level of sex discrimination, so long as the employee is not a confidential employee. All employees must be trained upon hiring and annually thereafter on 

1. the College’s obligation to address sex discrimination
2. the scope of conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, and
3. all duties of employees upon receipt of a report of sex discrimination, including to provide the reporting individual with contact information for the Title IX Coordinator and information about how to report sex discrimination under Title IX.

You can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. The College respects your right to file or not file a formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator may take action only in situations that pose a serious threat of harm to you or the community. 

**Nota Bene**: On January 9, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky vacated the Biden administration's 2024 Title IX regulations. The vacatur applies nationwide, meaning the 2020 Title IX final rule and Title IX regulations are effective. Due to this ruling, Allegheny College reverted back to their Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures prior to August 1, 2024.

##### Faculty As Mandated Reporters

Unless specifically identified otherwise by policy, all faculty, staff, and administrators of Allegheny College are considered mandated reporters and are required to notify the College’s Title IX Coordinator of any incident of discrimination and harassment disclosed to them, or known to them, involving a member of the campus community. Mandated reporting helps to ensure that individuals who are experiencing or have experienced discrimination or harassment are connected to the full range of resources and options afforded to them. 

If you are in need of support or advocacy and wish to discuss such matters confidentially, you are invited to consult any of the resources listed below. Unlike other College employees, the options below are confidential and are exempt from mandatory reporting obligations to the Title IX Coordinator. These resources are free and include both internal and external options.
