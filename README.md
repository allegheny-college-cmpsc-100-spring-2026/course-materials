#### Course Description

An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce computational artifacts which address these problems in real-world contexts. Students also learn how to organize and document a program’s source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

Distribution requirements: `ME`, `SP`

#### Course Learning Objectives

1. Apply Python programming fundamentals to execute and explain computer code that implements interactive, novel solutions to a variety of computable problems.
2. Implement code consistent with industry-standard practices using professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems.
3. Analyze and suggest revisions to existing Python language code to add functionality or repair defects.
4. Evaluate the practical and ethical implications of writing computer code and discuss the contexts, perceived effects, and impacts exerted on and by computer code as a cultural force or artifact.
5. Design, describe, and implement original projects incorporating industry-standard practices and Python language fundamentals.

#### Distribution Requirement Objectives

#####  Modes of Expression (ME)

The study of Modes of Expression explores individual and/or collective modes of expression, focusing upon the ways in which these modes create meaning and communicate thoughts, emotions, or beliefs to others. By engaging in hands-on experience, students interrogate the act of communication itself.

###### Learning Outcome

Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the production of meaning through active engagement with language, visual arts, and/or performance.

Course learning outcomes `1`, `2`, `4`, and `5` satisfy the `ME` learning outcome.

##### Scientific Process & Knowledge (SP)

Courses involving Scientific Process & Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

###### Learning Outcome

Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

Course learning outcomes `1`, `2`, `3`, and `5` satisfy the `SP` learning outcome.

### Required materials

#### Textbook

This course does not use a standard textbook. Any additional materials required for the course will be provided by the instructor.

#### Platforms

Our work relies on your regular use of:

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Discord](https://discord.com)

##### Github

Github is an industry-standard system for storing and _versioning_ (keeping working and finished copies of) software.
In a professional environment, developers `push` (or "upload") work to the platform multiple times per day to keep
their colleagues informed of changes made or in progress. 

As such, this course treats Github the same way: a method
to consistently "show your work," unlike a platform such as Canvas where it's more likely that a student submits
final work rather than work-in-process. Course assignments will be distributed through the Github platform. Neither TLs nor the instructor will review content _not_ submitted to the platform. This means that you should keep your work up to date.

#### Discord

The [Discord chat platform](https://discord.com) serves as the primary communications channel for course information. As courses in the CIS Department feature additional context or extended Q&A, it's importnant for students to keep up-to-date on posts to 
the channel. The instructor recommends that students download and install the destop application for Discord to monitor
channel activity. 

#### Grading and Evaluation

Given the technical nature of work in disciplines related to computer science, you may be tempted to think that this
course is only about one thing: the _right_ answer: whether the software _works_. While it's important for programs
to function, we're interested in much more than "yes" or "no" answers.

This course is broken down into `3` related components:

* class activities
* lab assignments
    * code reviews
    * technical benchmarks
* a final project
    * interview
    * technical benchmarks
